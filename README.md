Project Description:
In this project, we converted the previously developed Clothes Production Management System to utilize the Spring Boot framework, adhering to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. The project spanned a little over a week and involved a team of four members. Our primary objective was to enhance the system's architecture for better scalability and maintainability by leveraging the robust capabilities of Spring Boot.

Key aspects of the project included:

Framework Transition: Successfully migrated the existing Java-based system to Spring Boot, following the MVC pattern for improved structure and efficiency.
Functional Enhancements:
CRUD Operations for Order Requests: Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for managing order requests.
Pagination: Added pagination to handle large datasets effectively and improve user navigation.
SweetAlert2 Library Integration: Utilized SweetAlert2 to enhance user experience with better alert and confirmation dialogs.
Search Interface: Developed a user-friendly search interface to enable efficient data retrieval and management.
Collaboration and Tools: Used Git for version control and collaboration, ensuring seamless integration of work from all team members. Development tools included STS Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA for coding, and SQL Developer and DBeaver for database management.
This project provided significant experience in transitioning to a modern framework, improving my skills in Spring Boot, and enhancing collaboration through version control systems.
